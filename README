Based on:

* Murphy http://ftp.tw.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/dos/colors/murphy.vim

* Tango http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1686

* And uses the cool 256/80 color functions from Desert256 http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1243

Made by special request, but also so eventually I can come to a more unified
theory of syntax highlighting...

If you want it to look good in a terminal, make sure and do the following: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/256_colors_in_vim
